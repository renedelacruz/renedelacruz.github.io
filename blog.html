          <p class="blog-text">
            The cost of a home appraisal is typically a closing cost fee paid in advance by the home buyer at loan inception, after offer acceptance. The fees vary depending upon the location of the property and complexity of the appraisal process, but the cost of an appraisal is also driven somewhat by market demand, as with any other service.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you ask for an estimate of a home appraisal cost, the general answer seems to be in the $300 to $400 range, but that seems to be an outdated estimate.
          </p>
          <h6 style="color:#008080;">                                               How is the Appraiser Selected for a Home Appraisal?</h6>
          <p class="blog-text">
            When shopping for lenders, a prudent borrower might ask how the lender chooses an appraiser. Some might maintain a list of approved appraisers while others might use an Appraisal Management Company (AMC). The fees are not supposed to vary, so what generally happens is an appraiser selected through an AMC might get paid a bit less because the AMC takes a cut.
            <br><br>
            There are some AMCs who overcharge a borrower and pocket the difference, paying the appraiser peanuts. Some critics think there is a shortage of appraisers in the country but others believe it is a shortage of appraisers who are unwilling to work for so much less.
            <br><br>
            Some lenders may prefer to use an AMC for several reasons. First, some AMCs are owned and operated by appraisers themselves.
            <br><br>
            Second, some lenders feel using an AMC results in more arm’s length for the lender. A lender related a story that showcases why that lender prefers an AMC. A home sold at $500K in Davis, California. The appraiser determined mid-way through the appraisal that the appraisal would not meet the sales price and his appraisal would be about $400K.
          </p>
          <h6 style="color:#008080;">                                               Will an Appraiser Tell You If the Home Will Not Appraise at the Sales Price?</h6>
          <p class="blog-text">
            Appraisers are not immune to the fact that a buyer and a seller are counting on the home to appraise at the agreed upon contract value. Although an appraiser cannot base an appraisal on the sales price, don’t make the mistake of believing an appraiser is insensitive to that issue.
            <br><br>
            The appraisal situation in Davis, California, involved an FHA loan. FHA appraisals are assigned a case number, which means if the transaction fell through, the next FHA buyer would obtain the same appraisal. Because of that, the AMC called the lender to warn the appraisal would probably be $100,000 less the sales price and asked if the lender directed the appraiser to continue. The lender thanked the AMC and chose a different AMC company. In case you’re wondering, the lender paid the first AMC $150 for helping out.
            <br><br>
            However, the second AMC produced an appraisal at almost the same value, but it was still $95,000 less. Still, you can see how an arrangement with an AMC might be beneficial to a borrower. It is always possible a second appraiser would use different comparable sales and produce a higher appraisal. Appraisals are not absolute guarantees of value.
            <br><br>
            They are a professional’s opinion of value, following standard protocols.
            <br><br>
            Prior to the 2007 subprime mortgage meltdown, the cost for an appraisal in Sacramento was about $375 to $425. Conventional and FHA and VA appraisals do not cost the same. There is often a $50 difference in an appraisal fee between a conventional appraisal and an FHA appraisal, as FHA appraisals are more expensive.
            <br><br>
            That’s due in part to the additional requirements and guidelines for an FHA appraisal. An FHA appraisal might require more “loan conditions,” that is repair requirements before funding the loan, because FHA loans carry stricter guidelines than conventional. That’s why you might see some homes with peeling paint or deferred maintenance advertised as “conventional only.”
          </p>
          <h6 style="color:#008080;">                                             Why Do Homes Appraise All the Time at the Sales Price?</h6>
          <p class="blog-text">
            A buyer asked me a few days ago why every time she bought a home, that appraisal came in at the sales price. She wondered if there was some sort of collusion going on between the lenders and appraisers. The fact is appraisers receive a copy of the purchase offer. They try to find comparable sales that will meet the appraised value.
            <br><br>
            If the home is worth more than the sales price, sometimes the appraiser will not assign a higher value to the property because it’s unnecessary. It only needs to be worth at least the sales price. Not only is it unnecessary, but if the value is a lot higher, the lender might call that appraisal non-conforming and refuse to make the loan. Odd as that may sound. Appraisals must conform.

          <h4 style="color:#008080;">                               <b>How to get rid of PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)</b> | June 2017</h4>
          <p class="blog-text">
            If you bought a house with a down payment of less than 20 percent, your lender required you to buy mortgage insurance. The same goes if you refinanced with less than 20 percent equity.
            <br><br>
            Private mortgage insurance is expensive, and you can remove it after you have met some conditions. To remove PMI, or private mortgage insurance, you must have at least 20 percent equity in the home. You may ask the lender to cancel PMI when you have paid down the mortgage balance to 80 percent of the home’s original appraised value. When the balance drops to 78 percent, the mortgage servicer is required to eliminate PMI. Although you can cancel private mortgage insurance, you cannot cancel Federal Housing Administration insurance. You can get rid of FHA insurance by refinancing into a non-FHA-insured loan.

            <br><br>
            Here are steps you can take to cancel mortgage insurance sooner or strengthen your negotiating position:
            <br><br>
            Refinance: If your home value has increased enough, the new lender won’t require mortgage insurance.
Get a new appraisal: Some lenders will consider a new appraisal instead of the original sales price or appraised value when deciding whether you meet the 20 percent equity threshold. An appraisal generally costs $450 to $600. Before spending the money on an appraisal, ask the lender if this tactic will work in the specific case of your loan.
Prepay on your loan: Even $50 a month can mean a dramatic drop in your loan balance over time.
Remodel: Add a room or a pool to increase your home’s market value. Then ask the lender to recalculate your loan-to-value ratio using the new value figure.
Refinancing to get out of PMI
When mortgage rates are low, as they are now, refinancing can allow you not only to get rid of PMI, but to reduce your monthly interest payments. It’s a double-whammy of savings.
            <br><br>
            The refinancing tactic works if your home has gained substantial value since the last time you got a mortgage. For example, if you bought your house four years ago with a 10 percent down payment, and the home’s value has gone up 15 percent over that time, you now owe less than 80 percent of what the home is worth. Under these circumstances, you can refinance into a new loan without having to pay for PMI. Many loans have a “seasoning requirement” that requires you to wait at least two years before you can refinance to get rid of PMI. So if your loan is less than 2 years old, you can ask for a PMI-canceling refi, but you’re not guaranteed to get approval.
